# Standard IO PCB for PPUC Project
This is the hardware for a standard IO card which was designed for the PPUC pinball project, but can be useful in other applications as well.
It is designed for being low cost and functional for experimental use.  
Not everything is tested nor does it fulfill EMC or any other specifications.  
Use at your own risk!
To make use of anything of this project a basic understanding of electronics and programming is necessary. Nothing of it is "plug and play". I'm surely not liable for any damage to assemblies, pinball machines or even persons.

## Name
IO_16_8_1 as it has 16 inputs, 8 outputs and one special output.  
Actually the inputs can also be used as outputs (see later in this document).

## Power Supply
The IO card must be supplied by 5 V (+-0.5 V) for logic and inputs. Additionally nominal 48 V for high power outputs. As these outputs are open drain, the voltage can actually be up to 60 V. In the circuit diagram the voltage is called 48 V.

## Controller
A RP2040 is used for it's cost/performance ratio. It is the same controller that is used in the Raspberry Pi Pico.

## Communication Interfaces
* RS_485: main communication interface for controlling outputs and scan inputs. Usually connected to a host interface like a PC or Raspberry Pi or similar.
* USB C: for programming, debug and flashing
* Serial Wire: alternative for programming, debug and flashing
* IIC: the PCB can be populated with an QWIIC connector (normally not mounted). This can be used for connecting to other PCBs or experimental use. It uses the same UART as for the RS485.
* UART, I2C, SPI: instead of using the input pins for inputs they can also be used as an additional interface (see docu of RP2040 for pins and function). Speed up to 10 kHz should be possible (100 kHz for In_1 and In_2).

## Switches (on board)
* Reset: hardware reset for controller (RP2040)
* Boot: if active the board connects to a PC like an USB stick. Usually used for programming the code into the flash memory on the board.
* DIP-switches: usually used to select an address for RS485 (16 combinations)

## Inputs (and low power outputs)
The 16 inputs are used for reading the state of an external switch. The switch is normally connected to ground (GND). Internally the input is pulled up to 5 V by a 10k resistor.  

All inputs can also be used as signal-outputs (if programmed accordingly). The output is internally pulled up by a 10k resistor to 5 V. A higher voltage can be applied externally (max. 30 V) but be sure to have your hardware and software! setup correctly as no protection for damage is provided in that case. A maximum of 2 mA can be sinked/sourced.

The inputs In_1 and In_2 are designed for higher speed (100 kHz). The Pull-Up can be soldered to other pads to be pulled to 3,3 V (instead of 5 V). An input capacitance can be added (soldered) for better noise immunity but lower speed.

The inputs In_13 to In_16 have an additional open drain output transistor that allows higher currents in case of being used as an output (up to 3 A at 25 Â°C ambient temperature). The outputs are internally pulled up by a 10k resistor to 5 V. A higher voltage (max. 30 V) can be applied externally but be sure to have your hardware and software! setup correctly as no protection for damage is provided in that case.

## High Power Outputs
There are 8 high power outputs available. Usually they are connected to pinball solenoids or flashers. A recovery diode for the solenoids is placed on the pcb, so no need for diodes at the coils. The outputs are open drain and drive currents up to 6 A with a load connected to a voltage of up to 60 V.

It's recommended to use 2 wires (back and forth) for each solenoid. That improves the EMC a lot.

## Special Output
One special output is available for high speed signals. The voltage is 5 V, it is a push pull output that can drive a current up to 8 mA. It can be used to e.g. control a WS2812 LED strip.
