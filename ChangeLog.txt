	Corrected silkscreen printing on J1 and J8
	No extra version released as schematic and function is not affected and nobody ever used V1.1.1 yet


2024-11-16  foenich

	Released Version 1.1.1
	Updated MOSFETS for power outputs (more current at low UGS)
		
	* changed type of Q25-Q32 (same package, no change in layout)


2024-10-04  foenich

	Released Version 1.1.0
	Jumpers for RS485 bias and termination. Adjusted bias resistors.
	Prevented current from USB to 5V_IN.
	+5V no longer at terminal, only internal supply
	More terminals for A and B.
	Smaller Cap for +5V
	
	* removed F1 (as +5V is no loger at a terminal)
	* inserted D16
	* changed J8, pin 5 from +5V to GND
	* changed J1, pin 4 from GND to A and pin 5 from GND to B
	* inserted JP1 to JP3
	* changed C25 from 1000µ-throuhole to 100µ-SMD
	* changed R3 and R5 form 1k to 620 Ohm (worst case for 16 nodes (Rin=12k) and 120 Ohm at beginning and end)
	

2023-10-21  foenich

	Released Version 1.0.1

	* set C29 and C30 to mount

2023-10-21  foenich

	Released Version 1.0.0
	Correct geometry for impedance controlled traces for USB
	
	* changed USB-wire witdh and reduced distance to GND
	* changed versioning to x.y.z (major.functional change.bugfix)

2023-03-07  foenich
